# Wrecorder
## means Webaudio-recorder

This is a fork of mattdiamonds recorderjs. Due the fact that he dropped support on this project, i forked my own copy to have the possibility to fix bugs and add customizations.
For an official documentation refer to this repository:
[https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs](Matt Diamonds recorderjs)

## Bugs fixed
- The click event in the forceDownload-function didn't work properly. Replaced the event.
